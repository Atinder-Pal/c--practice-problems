# LoopsClassMarks

A program that will prompt for up to 20 marks, until the user enters all 20 or enters -1. Ensure that the user enters at least 1 mark. When done, output the average, highest and lowest marks from the “class”. Once finished, ask if they would like to start again. If they enter any integer that is not between -1 and 100 inclusive, prompt again and disregard the last input.
