These are the very first programs(not in sequence) I wrote to practice Basics of C#.


**ArrayOfNames:**
Create a program that will allow the user to insert, update, delete or output from a list of single word names (maximum 10). If the user wants to update or delete, ask if they would like to update/delete via name or index number. Display indexes starting at 1, as the user would be most accustomed to that numbering scheme. Do not allow the user to perform an insert or update that would create duplicate names. Do not allow names under two characters in length to be entered, nor names that are more than one word in length, nor only whitespace. Remove all leading and trailing whitespace from names entered. Ensure all names are stored in the array are title case, but inputs and searches are case insensitive. <br/>


**BillSplit:**
Calculate the amount each diner has to pay (split equally) from total bill value and number of diners as entered by the user. <br/>


**BirthYearFromAge:**
Finding the year of birth from the age entered by the user(assuming this year's birthday has passed). <br/>

**DoWhileLoopSayHello:**
Use a do while loop to print Hello on screen until the user types "stop"(case insensitive). <br/>


**ExceptionHandling1:**
Modify the program from "WhileLoopGetIntOneToTen" to allow user to enter non-numeric input without crashing the program. Also throw an exception if user enters an integer outside the range 1 to 10 inclusive.<br/>


**ExceptionHandling2:**
Modify program named "OperatorTwoOperands" from question 4 in the “Expressions and Decisions” section in order to allow the user to enter 0 as a divisor and not have the program crash. Prompt them for a new divisor if they do.<br/>


**ExceptionHandling3:**
Modify program "LoopsFizzBuzz" from question 3 in the “Iteration and Basic Validation” section to complete question 3 in the "Exception handling section.<br/>


**GuessEvenOddNumber:**
Taking in an Integer from user and determining if it is even or odd. <br/>


**GuessNumberGame:**
Generating a random number from 1 to 10 and asking 2 users to guess the number. <br/>

**GuessPerfectSquareNumber:**
Taking input from user and guessing if it is a perfect square of a whole number or not. <br/>


**HelloWorldHelloUserHelloEverybody:**
This is the very first program taught in class to simulate real world Project. Folowing were the requirements:
● App must display Hello World on screen <br/>● App must be written in C# <br/>● .exe must be delivered to client <br/>● Source code must be delivered to client <br/>● Maintenance and new features to be handled by client’s nephew.<br/>

**HighestLowestOfThreeIntegers:**
Take in Three integers and finding the highest and lowest integer. <br/>



**LoopsClassMrks:**
A program that will prompt for up to 20 marks, until the user enters all 20 or enters -1. Ensure that the user enters at least 1 mark. When done, output the average, highest and lowest marks from the “class”. Once finished, ask if they would like to start again. If they enter any integer that is not between -1 and 100 inclusive, prompt again and disregard the last input.<br/>



**LoopsFizzBuzz:**
Counting 1 to 100, replacing numbers divisible by 3 with 'Fizz, numbers divisible by '5' with 'Buzz' and numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 with 'FizzBuzz'.<br/>



**MonthAndNumberOfDays:**
Take 3 character code for a month from user. Then Display Full name of the month and number of days in that month. <br/>



**OperatorTwoOperands:**
Take Operator and two operands (int type) from user and perform the function.<br/>



**PaintRequiredForPosts:**
Take in a number of fence posts and determine how many buckets of paint will be required to paint the fence posts. One bucket paints 4 fence posts.<br/>

**PythagorasTheorem:**
Calculating Hypotenuse from given base and perpendicular measurements.<br/>



**RandomPasswordFiveCharLong:**
Generate a random password which is 5 characters long and can consist uppercase characters. <br/>



**StringToUpperCase:**
Taking in a string and changing it to uppercase. <br/>



**SumOfDigitsOfFourDigitNumber:**
take in a 4 digit integer and calculate the sum of its digits without ever converting the integer to a string. <br/>

**WhileLoopGetIntOneToTen:**
Prompt the user for an integer, and continue prompting until an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive) is entered. Use a while loop.<br/>
