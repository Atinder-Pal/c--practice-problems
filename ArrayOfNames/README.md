# ArrayOfNames
Create a program that will allow the user to insert, update, delete or output from a list of single word names (maximum 10). If the user wants to update or delete, ask if they would like to update/delete via name or index number. Display indexes starting at 1, as the user would be most accustomed to that numbering scheme. Do not allow the user to perform an insert or update that would create duplicate names. Do not allow names under two characters in length to be entered, nor names that are more than one word in length, nor only whitespace. Remove all leading and trailing whitespace from names entered. Ensure all names are stored in the array are title case, but inputs and searches are case insensitive
